    LPG Gas Manufacturing Process:

<p>LPG is manufactured by refining crude oil or processing raw natural gas, all of which are sourced from fossil fuel. LPG is produced by stripping it from the “wet” natural gas stream as it comes out of the well or separating it from the crude oil during LPG refinery process.

    Liquefied petroleum gas – LPG – is produced by stripping it from the raw natural gas stream during natural gas processing and during crude refinery process. The primary LPG constituents produced are propane and butane, with small amounts of other natural gas liquids. Liquefied through pressurization, LPG is easier to store and transport.
    
    LPG is produced during fractional distillation of crude oil or is separated during natural gas processing. To transport or store it, LPG gas needs to be liquefied under pressure. LPG can be stored or transported in LPG gas cylinders or vessels. If released from pressure, LPG gas is emitted.
